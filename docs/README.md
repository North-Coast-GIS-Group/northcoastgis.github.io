Thanks everyone for making the first meeting a big success!
I'm working on putting together other channels for us
to stay in touch now, first an email announcements list
and then Rocket.chat or a channel on Slack or Twitter.
(Just kidding. Not using Twitter.)

For now you can send us mail at
[info@northcoastgis.group](mailto:info@northcoastgis.group)

BTW, if you want to help with this web site, let me know. :-)
At the moment it's using ["Pages"](https://pages.github.com/) and its 
[hosted at Github.com](https://github.com/North-Coast-GIS-Group/northcoastgis.github.io.git)
and it's pretty easy to work with. Just takes time. At the moment I need to find the right
[Pages theme](https://pages.github.com/themes/) to use. The current one is called "minimal".
